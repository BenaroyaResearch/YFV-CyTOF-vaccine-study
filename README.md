# YFV-CyTOF-vaccine-study
Analysis of CyTOF data generated for the manuscript "Ontogeny of different subsets of Yellow Fever Virus-specific circulatory CXCR5+ CD4+ T cells after Yellow Fever Vaccination"

The .Rmd file contains code used for the analysis described in "Ontogeny of different subsets of Yellow Fever Virus-specific circulatory CXCR5+ CD4+ T cells after Yellow Fever Vaccination". FCS files were loaded using the flowCore package and an arcsinh transformation was applied. Uniform manifold projection (UMAP) and R Phenograph clustering were used to visualize and analyze the CyTOF data.
